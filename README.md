# LeetCode Problem Solutions
Welcome to the LeetCode Problem Solutions Repository! This repository contains solutions to various problems from LeetCode. Whether you're practicing for coding interviews, honing your algorithmic skills, or simply enjoying problem-solving challenges, this repository offers a collection of solutions to help you in your journey.

## Introduction

LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding skills, particularly for technical interviews. It features a wide range of coding problems across different domains such as algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, and more. This repository provides solutions to problems available on LeetCode.

## Concepts 

### Hash Maps
Hash maps are indexed data structures. In python, dictionaries are used to implement hash maps. Hash maps allows fast random memory access throug hash functions along with fast insertion and deletion.

```
# Default dict in python
# defaultdict is subclass of built in class dict. It overrides one method to 
# provide a default value for a non existent key. 

temp_dict = defaultdict(int)
print(temp_dict)
# OUTPUT: defaultdict(int, {})

temp_dict['a'] +=1   # craete a new key 'a' and increment its value by 1,
# default value for non existent key is 0
print(temp_dict['pear]) # output: 0

temp_dict_list = defaultdict(list)
print(temp_dict)
# OUTPUT: defaultdict(list, {})
```
